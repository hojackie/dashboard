## Barcode Medication Administration Scanning

### Nursing Compliance Dashboard
Great way to place actionable data into the hand of front line managers. This dashboard will allow nurse managers to identify root causes to low scan compliance and track user compliance. This dashboard is interactive and will allow end-users to do special drill downs on user specific data.

### Pharmacy Medication Non-Scan Investigation Dashboard
This dashboard allows pharmacy front line leaders to identify medicaitons that are not scanning and view trends (e.g., is there a particular area that is not scanning this medication, has this always been a medication that does not scan or has operational issues affected scanning of this medication, etc.).
